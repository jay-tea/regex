This is a general technique you can use to check if a string contains some set of letters, words, or even substrings described by more complex patterns, in any order.

The example checks if a word contains all 5 vowels in any order:

Expression: (?:\w*?(?:a()|e()|i()|o()|u()))++\1\2\3\4\5

Example matched strings: "aeiou", "eunoia", "facetious"
